    blurb: 'Our signature metal. Spun, cast and machined, brass moves from yellow to deep gold as it ages — a finish that improves with every year of handling.',

    slug: 'copper', name: 'Copper', index: '02', ratio: '16/15',
    trait: 'Soft · conductive · alive',
    blurb: 'Raised and hammered by hand, copper takes a patina like no other metal — verdigris greens, fire-blues and rose-golds coaxed from the surface, never painted on.',
    note: 'Tinned for cookware; patinated for relief work.',

    slug: 'blown-glass', name: 'Blown Glass', index: '05', ratio: '16/15',

    blurb: 'Mouth-blown by our glass partner in Murano, then married to metal in the atelier. Opal, clear and smoked — the diffuser that turns a fixture into light.',

  {
    slug: 'wood', name: 'Wood', index: '06', ratio: '16/15',
